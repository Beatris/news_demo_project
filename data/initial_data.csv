Denmark will cull entire mink population after COVID-19 outbreaks,"Photo by Mads Claus Rasmussen/Ritzau Scanpix/AFP/Getty Images

  
Denmark plans to cull up to 17 million mink, the country’s entire population, after reports that the animals could pass a coronavirus mutation to humans. The announcement came from Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen at a press conference, and there are currently no published scientific reports on the mutation or its effects. 
The virus has been found at over 200 mink farms in Denmark, which produces most of the world’s mink fur. Over a million animals were already culled on Danish farms in October. This summer, about 100,000 mink were culled in Spain after similar outbreaks. Outbreaks on mink farms in Utah killed thousands of animals. 
Denmark’s announcement comes after 12 people in the country were found to be infected with a type of the...

Missing Halloween while the pandemic rages on? Twitter's got you covered.,"Happy Halloween! 

Hm. ""Happy"" may be a bit too much in this, the year of our shared pandemic. But it is Oct. 31, the day of Halloween, and a little lockdown isn't going to stop people from dressing up. Especially since social media exists.

It may not be as easy to go trick-or-treating in 2020, but that doesn't mean we can't appreciate all the hard work that went into crafting inventive costumes. People are still dressing up this year, and they're doing a bang-up job of it.

This is nothing more than an appreciation post for all the super Halloween costumes we won't get to see on the local streets in 2020. And that's a good thing! It means people are staying safe. Just wear a mask, be a responsible community member, and keep kicking ass. If we all take some personal responsibility in fighting this thing back, we can make Halloween 2021 the epic party it deserves to be. Read more...

Bridgerton — which looks like an extra-horny Georgian Gossip Girl — takes place in London high society, where Daphne Bridgerton (Phoebe Dynevor) is looking for a husband. Her efforts are hindered by Lady Whistledown (voiced in the trailer by Julie Andrews!), who is determined to expose any dirt about the season's singles and positively lives for the drama. Will Daphne survive her century's gossip column? Will she love or hate the Duke of Hastings (Regé-Jean Page) — or both?

With the exception of The Morning Show, Apple TV Plus barely managed to enter the conversation, while other new entrants like Disney Plus soared right out the gate. 
But streaming isn’t a sprint; it’s a marathon. The anniversary of Apple TV Plus arrives with the platform getting better each month, but it’s still not where Apple needs it to be.

Lessons from tearing down the iPhone 12,"iFixit

  
In the recent teardown of the iPhone 12 by iFixit, it was found that the new phone runs into some issues if a user replaces the camera module, basically rendering the cameras on the device unusable if not replaced by an Apple-authorized repair provider. 
iFixit has frequently spoken out against the control consumer electronics companies have for repairing their products, advocating for policy changes for the right to repair. In a recent post on its site, it questions whether the iPhone 12 is the “end of the repairable iPhone.”
In this week’s final episode of our limited-run podcast series on tech review season, The Vergecast’s Dieter Bohn talks with iFixit’s Kyle Wiens and Kay-Kay Clapp about their thoughts on the repairability of...

The best dating sites for guys looking to find love,"Dating can be difficult. Sometimes you want to make the first move, but you don't want to appear too eager.

If you're lost, we recommend trying online dating.

There are a lot of great sites out there that can help you find someone special. The only really issue is that with all of the options, it can sometimes feel like there's too much choice. Throw in busy lives and daily responsibilities, and the thought of combing through loads of profiles sounds like the last thing you want to do. We get it, we really do.  Read more...

"Voting for Biden or Trump? Either way, you're not on the right side of history.","We have reached a moment in American history when everything seems to be at stake in a single presidential election: equal rights, democracy, the country's future. 

Joe Biden and Donald Trump voters alike believe that it'll spell doom if their opponent wins. Putting aside for a moment the legitimacy of those fears, consider the voter who casts their ballot believing they're on the right side of history. 

This phrase provides comfort at times of deep uncertainty. It's how people feel more confident in their convictions: They believe that when the history of this chapter is written, their views will be vindicated, even if they were controversial or disputed at the time. After all, no one wants to be on the wrong side of history.  Read more...

What Prop. 22 could mean for the gig economy nationwide,"After Election Day in California, labor groups and coalitions of drivers were devastated. Ride-hailing companies were relieved. 

With Prop. 22's passage in California, Lyft, Uber, DoorDash, and other apps that rely on so-called gig workers will continue to treat those workers as independent contractors. (The SF Chronicle put the vote at 58 percent for, 41 percent against.) 

If the measure failed, the state's new(ish) employee classification law AB 5 would have turned those contractors into employees with benefits. 

So what does this mean for the rest of the country? California is often a bellwether. New York, Massachusetts, and other states considering gig economy legislation could look to its new ""hybrid"" model, in which companies give workers some limited benefits. Read more...

Over 1 million people around the world have died, hundreds of thousands get sick every day, and the United States has the distinction of the worst outbreak in the world. 
When we published our first guide to the coronavirus, researchers still weren’t sure how the virus spread, when people were contagious, or if you could catch it twice. There’s still some lingering uncertainty around some of those questions, but...

Waymo is pulling its autonomous vehicles out of San Francisco in anticipation of Election Day unrest, The Verge has learned.

GameStop made a TikTok contest for employees where the prize is more hours to work,"Photo by John Nacion/SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images

  
GameStop holds an annual conference for its employees, and this year’s event includes a rather unnerving TikTok challenge: make the best dance video, and your store can win the privilege of letting employees work for extra hours during Black Friday.
The contest, spotted by TheGamer, has since been pulled from GameStop’s website after the promotion received media attention and press inquiries. GameStop did not respond to The Verge’s requests for comment or clarification.
For the contest, GameStop asked employees to upload a video to TikTok showing them dancing to a brief song. The contest is meant for “store leaders,” and the company encourages them to get other employees to help. “Be creative, rope in your team, and have fun with it!”...

YouTuber conquers cheese fondue fountain in heartwarming sequel,"If you don't succeed, try, try again. YouTuber Tasty Hoon recently went viral when his fried chicken and cheese mukbang went hilariously wrong. He's now tried the combination again to greater success, this time making sure his cheese fondue can actually flow through the chocolate fountain he's set up.

Tasty Hoon takes us through the entire process of making cheese fondue in his new video uploaded on Sunday, being sure to include a respectable amount of milk to keep it liquid. Putting it in the fountain still makes him visibly nervous considering what happened last time, but his apprehension instantly turns to giddy joy when he realises it's working.  Read more...

Obama sank a perfect three-pointer that even impressed LeBron James,"""That's what I do!""

In a bitter 2020 election campaign that's been shaped by pandemic misery and Donald Trump's criminal malfeasance, Barack Obama brought some lighthearted joy into race. In a tweet blasted out Saturday night, we get to see the former president snatch up a basketball and sink a perfect three-point shot.

The tweet caption? ""Shoot your shot,"" followed by a link to iwillvote.com. (Election day is Nov. 3, please do get out and vote.)




As the laughing ex-president leaves the court, he turns and looks directly at the camera, twice shouting ""That's what I do!"" with a big smile on his face. Former vice president and current White House contender Joe Biden follows his former boss out, exclaiming ""All net!"" Read more...

The People Detection feature, which is activated by tapping on the rightmost icon in Magnifier's UI, uses LiDAR and the phone's camera to detect people in the camera's field of view.

The feature is primarily meant as aid for the visually impaired, giving them a way to assess whether people are nearby, as well as notify them when they move closer. When it detects movement, it can provide feedback in four different ways:  Read more...

Anthony Fauci is probably one of the most recognizable faces of the coronavirus pandemic in the US. So when a public health expert needed a way to measure how her students were coping with all of the stresses of 2020, she created a chart to gauge their “level of Fauci.” 
“We all kind of need something that’s positive, that makes sense to us,” Karen Sautter Errichetti, an assistant professor in public health and community medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine, said. She’d noticed that her community of public health and medical professionals was feeling pretty depressed. So to lighten the mood and get the students interested, she and her co-instructor Reece Lyerly start every class with a meme of some sort.

Facial recognition used to arrest protestor at Trump bible photo op,"Of course a little known facial recognition tool was used on Black Lives Matter protestors.

This past June, as protestors were tear-gassed in Washington D.C.'s Lafayette Square so that Donald Trump could have a bible-thumping photo op, officials claim a man assaulted a police officer. The man, Michael Joseph Peterson Jr., wasn't arrested at the scene. Instead, police pulled images off Twitter and ran them through a previously secretive facial recognition system to find a match. 

So reports the Washington Post, which notes that many experts believe this is the first time a defendant has been told the National Capital Region Facial Recognition Investigative Leads System (NCRFRILS), as it is called, was used to track them down. This, despite the fact that the NCRFRILS has reportedly been used over 12,000 times. Read more...

The COVID-19 exposure notification app used in England and Wales failed to warn users if they were in close contact with potentially infectious COVID-19 patients. Because of the error, thousands of people were not told to quarantine even when they should have been, according to the Sunday Times, which first reported the flaw.

While it’s easy to dismiss it as just another fancy vibration feature, the new DualSense controller goes beyond what I’ve ever experienced on a Nintendo Switch, Xbox controller, or even the great haptic feedback you’ll find on modern smartphones. The key addition are these new...

"No, Sean Connery did not write a mean letter to Steve Jobs","The late Steve Jobs  | Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images

  
A fake letter from Sean Connery to Apple co-founder Steve Jobs is making the rounds on social media following the actor’s death on Saturday. Just to reiterate: it’s fake, the product of humor site Scoopertino, which posts satirical articles about Apple and goings-on at its Cupertino (get it that’s the name) headquarters. 
The typewritten letter dated 1998 purports to show Connery’s outrage over Jobs asking him to appear in an Apple commercial. “I do not sell my soul for Apple or any other company. I have no interest in ‘changing the world’ as you suggest,” it states. “You are a computer salesman, I am fucking JAMES BOND!”
But the internet loves things that are too good to be true, and Sunday morning, the “letter” was circulating on...

In the summer, when the sun is shining and temperatures soar, we are more content to remain single. We socialise more, meet new people, and enjoy the feeling of being untethered. However, as we enter the colder months, we yearn for companionship. It’s a fact. It’s science. It’s instinct.  Read more...
